1
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:15,428
If there's any power in design,

2
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:17,771
that's the power of synthesis.

3
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:19,466
The more complex the problem,

4
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:21,967
the more the need for simplicity.

5
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:24,303
So allow me to share three cases

6
00:00:24,303 --> 00:00:26,113
where we tried to apply

7
00:00:26,114 --> 00:00:29,117
design's power of synthesis.

8
00:00:29,117 --> 00:00:33,218
Let's start with the global challenge of urbanization.

9
00:00:33,218 --> 00:00:36,896
It's a fact that people are moving towards cities.

10
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:40,361
and even if counterintuitive, it's good news.

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,443
Evidence shows that people are better off in cities.

12
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,593
But there's a problem that I would call

13
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:48,899
the "3S" menace:

14
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,631
The scale, speed, and scarcity of means

15
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:54,826
with which we will have to
respond to this phenomenon

16
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:57,464
has no precedence in history.

17
00:00:57,465 --> 00:00:58,654
For you to have an idea,

18
00:00:58,654 --> 00:01:01,880
out of the three billion
people living in cities today,

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,271
one billion are under the line of poverty.

20
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:09,210
By 2030, out of the five billion people

21
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:11,479
that will be living in cities,

22
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,837
two billion are going to
be under the line of poverty.

23
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:19,266
That means that we will have to build

24
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:28,445
a one million-person city per week

25
00:01:30,114 --> 00:01:35,671
with 10,000 dollars per family

26
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:37,481
during the next 15 years.

27
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:40,206
A one million-person city per week

28
00:01:40,206 --> 00:01:42,329
with 10,000 dollars per family.

29
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:43,995
If we don't solve this equation,

30
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:46,043
it is not that people
will stop coming to cities.

31
00:01:46,043 --> 00:01:47,952
They will come anyhow,

32
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:50,957
but they will live in slums, favelas

33
00:01:50,957 --> 00:01:52,367
and informal settlements.

34
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:55,245
So what to do? Well, an answer may come

35
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:59,839
from favelas and slums themselves.

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,433
A clue could be in this
question we were asked

37
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:04,890
10 years ago.

38
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,520
We were asked to accommodate 100 families

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,938
that had been occupying illegally

40
00:02:10,938 --> 00:02:13,233
half a hectare in the center

41
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:16,134
of the city of Iquique
in the north of Chile

42
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:19,061
using a $10,000 subsidy

43
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:22,176
with which we had to buy the land,

44
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,908
provide the infrastructure,

45
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:27,229
and build the houses that,
in the best of the cases,

46
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:30,893
would be of around 40 square meters.

47
00:02:30,894 --> 00:02:33,099
And by the way, they said,

48
00:02:33,098 --> 00:02:34,750
the cost of the land,

49
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,806
because it's in the center of the city,

50
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:38,550
is three times more

51
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,108
than what social housing can normally afford.

52
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:44,334
Due to the difficulty of the question,

53
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:46,515
we decided to include the families

54
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:50,611
in the process of understanding the constraints,

55
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:53,192
and we started a participatory design process,

56
00:02:53,193 --> 00:02:56,840
and testing what was
available there in the market.

57
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,538
Detached houses,

58
00:02:58,538 --> 00:03:01,493
30 families could be accommodated.

59
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:05,455
Row houses, 60 families.

60
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:08,597
["100 families"]
The only way to accommodate all of them

61
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:10,920
was by building in height,

62
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,551
and they threatened us

63
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:14,859
to go on a hunger strike

64
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,158
if we even dared to offer this

65
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:18,583
as a solution,

66
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:21,655
because they could not
make the tiny apartments

67
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:23,109
expand.

68
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:25,798
So the conclusion with the families —

69
00:03:25,798 --> 00:03:27,675
and this is important,
not our conclusion —

70
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:30,206
with the families, was that we had a problem.

71
00:03:30,206 --> 00:03:31,944
We had to innovate.

72
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:34,610
So what did we do?

73
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:39,618
Well, a middle-class family

74
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:42,498
lives reasonably well

75
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:44,849
in around 80 square meters,

76
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,521
but when there's no money,

77
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:47,864
what the market does

78
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:52,122
is to reduce the size of the house

79
00:03:52,122 --> 00:03:54,971
to 40 square meters.

80
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:56,718
What we said was,

81
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:59,239
what if,

82
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:05,377
instead of thinking of 40 square meters

83
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:08,058
as a small house,

84
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:10,384
why don't we consider it

85
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:13,191
half of a good one?

86
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:14,957
When you rephrase the problem

87
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:17,663
as half of a good house

88
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:19,298
instead of a small one,

89
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:22,507
the key question is, which half do we do?

90
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:25,209
And we thought we had
to do with public money

91
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:30,618
the half that families won't
be able to do individually.

92
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:33,147
We identified five design conditions

93
00:04:33,146 --> 00:04:35,504
that belonged to the hard half of a house,

94
00:04:35,504 --> 00:04:38,600
and we went back to the
families to do two things:

95
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,600
join forces and split tasks.

96
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,584
Our design was something in between

97
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:48,264
a building and a house.

98
00:04:48,264 --> 00:04:50,356
As a building, it could pay

99
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,349
for expensive, well-located land,

100
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:56,969
and as a house, it could expand.

101
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,554
If, in the process of not being expelled

102
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:01,919
to the periphery while getting a house,

103
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,733
families kept their
network and their jobs,

104
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:08,980
we knew that the expansion
would begin right away.

105
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,536
So we went from this initial social housing

106
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:17,930
to a middle-class unit achieved
by families themselves

107
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,665
within a couple of weeks.

108
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:22,439
This was our first project

109
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,766
in Iquique 10 years ago.

110
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:28,242
This is our last project in Chile.

111
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:31,194
Different designs, same principle:

112
00:05:31,194 --> 00:05:32,759
You provide the frame,

113
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,598
and from then on, families take over.

114
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:40,698
So the purpose of design,

115
00:05:40,697 --> 00:05:43,707
trying to understand and
trying to give an answer

116
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,360
to the "3S" menace,

117
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,826
scale, speed, and scarcity,

118
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:50,309
is to channel people's own building capacity.

119
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:54,713
We won't solve the one million
people per week equation

120
00:05:54,713 --> 00:05:59,399
unless we use people's own power for building.

121
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,634
So, with the right design,

122
00:06:01,634 --> 00:06:05,035
slums and favelas may not be the problem

123
00:06:05,035 --> 00:06:08,784
but actually the only possible solution.

124
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:11,819
The second case is how design can contribute

125
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,871
to sustainability.

126
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,263
In 2012, we entered the competition

127
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:18,829
for the Angelini Innovation Center,

128
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,841
and the aim was to build

129
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:25,175
the right environment for knowledge creation.

130
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:27,659
It is accepted that for such an aim,

131
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,196
knowledge creation,

132
00:06:29,196 --> 00:06:31,783
interaction among people,
face-to-face contact,

133
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:33,980
it's important, and we agreed on that.

134
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,556
But for us, the question
of the right environment

135
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:39,721
was a very literal question.

136
00:06:39,721 --> 00:06:41,841
We wanted to have a working space

137
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:44,594
with the right light, with the right temperature,

138
00:06:44,595 --> 00:06:46,477
with the right air.

139
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:48,554
So we asked ourselves:

140
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:51,144
Does the typical office building

141
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,255
help us in that sense?

142
00:06:53,255 --> 00:06:56,869
Well, how does that
building look, typically?

143
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,454
It's a collection of floors,

144
00:06:59,454 --> 00:07:01,360
one on top of each other,

145
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,401
with a core in the center

146
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:09,090
with elevators, stairs,
pipes, wires, everything,

147
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:12,676
and then a glass skin on the outside

148
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:16,552
that, due to direct sun radiation,

149
00:07:16,552 --> 00:07:21,761
creates a huge greenhouse effect inside.

150
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:23,695
In addition to that, let's say a guy

151
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,430
working on the seventh floor

152
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,141
goes every single day
through the third floor,

153
00:07:28,141 --> 00:07:31,180
but has no idea what the guy on that floor

154
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,908
is working on.

155
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:36,305
So we thought, well, maybe
we have to turn this scheme

156
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:38,105
inside out.

157
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:39,927
And what we did was,

158
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:44,110
let's have an open atrium,

159
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,999
a hollowed core,

160
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,612
the same collection of floors,

161
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:52,052
but have the walls and the mass in the perimeter,

162
00:07:52,052 --> 00:07:56,317
so that when the sun hits,

163
00:07:56,317 --> 00:08:02,444
it's not impacting directly glass, but a wall.

164
00:08:02,444 --> 00:08:05,181
When you have an open atrium inside,

165
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,329
you are able to see what others are doing

166
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:09,180
from within the building, and you have

167
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,379
a better way to control light,

168
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:14,783
and when you place the mass and the walls

169
00:08:14,783 --> 00:08:16,439
in the perimeter,

170
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:19,872
then you are preventing direct sun radiation.

171
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:21,792
You may also open those windows

172
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,687
and get cross-ventilation.

173
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:27,622
We just made those openings

174
00:08:27,622 --> 00:08:29,714
of such a scale that they could work

175
00:08:29,714 --> 00:08:31,727
as elevated squares,

176
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:33,471
outdoor spaces throughout

177
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:37,134
the entire height of the building.

178
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:38,984
None of this is rocket science.

179
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:41,682
You don't require sophisticated programming.

180
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:43,415
It's not about technology.

181
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:48,838
This is just archaic,
primitive common sense,

182
00:08:48,837 --> 00:08:50,805
and by using common sense,

183
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:53,787
we went from 120 kilowatts

184
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:56,127
per square meter per year,

185
00:08:56,126 --> 00:08:58,298
which is the typical energy consumption

186
00:08:58,298 --> 00:09:00,289
for cooling a glass tower,

187
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:04,620
to 40 kilowatts per square meter per year.

188
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,897
So with the right design,

189
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:09,441
sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use

190
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:13,173
of common sense.

191
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:16,146
Last case I would like
to share is how design

192
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:18,442
can provide more comprehensive answers

193
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:20,830
against natural disasters.

194
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,895
You may know that Chile, in 2010,

195
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:27,699
was hit by an 8.8 Richter scale

196
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,823
earthquake and tsunami,

197
00:09:29,822 --> 00:09:31,697
and we were called to work

198
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,939
in the reconstruction of the Constitución,

199
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,850
in the southern part of the country.

200
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,346
We were given 100 days, three months,

201
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,263
to design almost everything,

202
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:43,580
from public buildings to public space,

203
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,670
street grid, transportation, housing,

204
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,423
and mainly how to protect the city

205
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:50,678
against future tsunamis.

206
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:53,828
This was new in Chilean urban design,

207
00:09:53,828 --> 00:09:57,201
and there were in the
air a couple of alternatives.

208
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:58,453
First one:

209
00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:01,102
Forbid installation on ground zero.

210
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:03,139
Thirty million dollars spent mainly

211
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:05,524
in land expropriation.

212
00:10:05,524 --> 00:10:08,785
This is exactly what's being
discussed in Japan nowadays,

213
00:10:08,785 --> 00:10:10,832
and if you have a disciplined population

214
00:10:10,832 --> 00:10:13,173
like the Japanese, this may work,

215
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:14,658
but we know that in Chile,

216
00:10:14,658 --> 00:10:18,471
this land is going to be
occupied illegally anyhow,

217
00:10:18,471 --> 00:10:22,543
so this alternative was
unrealistic and undesirable.

218
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:25,936
Second alternative: build a big wall,

219
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:28,253
heavy infrastructure to resist

220
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,195
the energy of the waves.

221
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:32,314
This alternative was conveniently lobbied

222
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:33,674
by big building companies,

223
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:37,881
because it meant 42 million
dollars in contracts,

224
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:40,234
and was also politically preferred,

225
00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:44,226
because it required no land expropriation.

226
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,976
But Japan proved that trying to resist

227
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:50,289
the force of nature is useless.

228
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:53,653
So this alternative was irresponsible.

229
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,747
As in the housing process,

230
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:57,623
we had to include the community

231
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:00,971
in the way of finding a solution for this,

232
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:04,144
and we started a participatory design process.

233
00:11:04,144 --> 00:11:06,415
(Video) [In Spanish] Loudspeaker:
What kind of city do you want?

234
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,958
Vote for Constitución.

235
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:10,262
Go to the Open House and express your options.

236
00:11:10,263 --> 00:11:12,436
Participate!

237
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:14,509
Fisherman: I am a fisherman.

238
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:16,619
Twenty-five fishermen work for me.

239
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:18,958
Where should I take them? To the forest?

240
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:22,342
Man: So why can't we have a concrete defense?

241
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:24,250
Done well, of course.

242
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,140
Man 2: I am the history of Constitución.

243
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,100
And you come here to tell me
that I cannot keep on living here?

244
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,298
My whole family has lived here,

245
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:33,770
I raised my children here,

246
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,855
and my children will also
raise their children here.

247
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:38,364
and my grandchildren
and everyone else will.

248
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,889
But why are you imposing this on me?

249
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:42,766
You! You are imposing this on me!

250
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:44,558
In danger zone I am not authorized to build.

251
00:11:44,557 --> 00:11:46,144
He himself is saying that.

252
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:48,230
Man 3: No, no, no, Nieves...

253
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,228
Alejandro Aravena: I don't know if you were able

254
00:11:53,227 --> 00:11:55,512
to read the subtitles, but you can tell

255
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:57,157
from the body language

256
00:11:57,157 --> 00:11:58,435
that participatory design

257
00:11:58,434 --> 00:12:00,758
is not a hippie, romantic,

258
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,009
let's-all-dream-together-about-
the-future-of-the-city

259
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:06,076
kind of thing.

260
00:12:06,076 --> 00:12:09,570
It is actually — (Applause)

261
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,970
It is actually not even with the families

262
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,016
trying to find the right answer.

263
00:12:15,015 --> 00:12:17,828
It is mainly trying to identify with precision

264
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:19,899
what is the right question.

265
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:21,986
There is nothing worse than answering well

266
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:24,091
the wrong question.

267
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:27,409
So it was pretty obvious after this process

268
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:30,940
that, well, we chicken out here

269
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:33,517
and go away because it's too tense,

270
00:12:33,517 --> 00:12:35,543
or we go even further in asking,

271
00:12:35,543 --> 00:12:36,937
what else is bothering you?

272
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:38,691
What other problems do you have

273
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,273
and you want us to take
care of now that the city

274
00:12:41,273 --> 00:12:45,595
will have to be rethought from scratch?

275
00:12:45,595 --> 00:12:47,791
And what they said was,

276
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,576
look, fine to protect the city
against future tsunamis,

277
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:55,333
we really appreciate, but the next one
is going to come in, what, 20 years?

278
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,426
But every single year, we have problems

279
00:12:57,427 --> 00:13:00,290
of flooding due to rain.

280
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:02,490
In addition, we are in the middle

281
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,288
of the forest region of the country,

282
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:07,109
and our public space sucks.

283
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:10,900
It's poor and it's scarce.

284
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:13,483
And the origin of the city, our identity,

285
00:13:13,484 --> 00:13:16,370
is not really connected to the buildings that fell,

286
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,984
it is connected to the river,

287
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:20,798
but the river cannot be accessed publicly,

288
00:13:20,798 --> 00:13:24,500
because its shores are privately owned.

289
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,302
So we thought that we had
to produce a third alternative,

290
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:33,846
and our approach was
against geographical threats,

291
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,466
have geographical answers.

292
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:41,254
What if, in between the city

293
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,983
and the sea

294
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,768
we have a forest,

295
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:54,354
a forest that doesn't try to resist

296
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:56,211
the energy of nature,

297
00:13:56,211 --> 00:14:00,270
but dissipates it by introducing friction?

298
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:04,163
A forest that may be able to laminate the water

299
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:06,514
and prevent the flooding?

300
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:11,598
That may pay the historical debt of public space,

301
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:14,242
and that may provide, finally,

302
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:16,659
democratic access to the river.

303
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:19,600
So as a conclusion of the participatory design,

304
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,604
the alternative was validated politically and socially,

305
00:14:22,604 --> 00:14:25,715
but there was still the problem of the cost:

306
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:28,918
48 million dollars.

307
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:31,322
So what we did was a survey

308
00:14:31,322 --> 00:14:33,875
in the public investment system,

309
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,190
and found out that there
were three ministries

310
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,333
with three projects in
the exact same place,

311
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:42,297
not knowing of the existence
of the other projects.

312
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:46,634
The sum of them: 52 million dollars.

313
00:14:46,634 --> 00:14:49,310
So design's power of synthesis

314
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:51,425
is trying to make a more efficient use

315
00:14:51,426 --> 00:14:54,283
of the scarcest resource in cities,

316
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:57,696
which is not money but coordination.

317
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,478
By doing so, we were able to save

318
00:15:00,477 --> 00:15:03,319
four million dollars, and
that is why the forest

319
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,900
is today under construction.

320
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,515
(Applause)

321
00:15:09,515 --> 00:15:13,139
So be it the force of self construction,

322
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:16,245
the force of common sense,

323
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:19,350
or the force of nature, all these forces

324
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,781
need to be translated into form,

325
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,447
and what that form is modeling and shaping

326
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:29,677
is not cement, bricks, or wood.

327
00:15:29,677 --> 00:15:31,922
It is life itself.

328
00:15:31,922 --> 00:15:34,259
Design's power of synthesis

329
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:36,679
is just an attempt to put

330
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:40,311
at the innermost core of architecture

331
00:15:40,312 --> 00:15:42,180
the force of life.

332
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:44,968
Thank you so much.

333
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:48,890
(Applause)
